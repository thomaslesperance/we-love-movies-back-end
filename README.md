# WeLoveMovies

## Context
WeLoveMovies is a simple CRUDL API created to showcase skills with both the Express web framework as well a PostgreSQL database connection using the Knex library.

## How to Use

This project requires the use of a PostgreSQL database (either local or remote).

1. Fork and clone repo
2. npm install
3. (From root directory of project): touch .env
4. Append the following to .env: DATABASE_URL="[your database URL here]"
5. npm run start:dev
6. (Separate terminal): npm run seed
7. Open browser to localhost:5001
8. Append browser URL with any of the valid application paths (e.g., /movies/2/reviews)

## Features
Here is an image of what a frontend to the application might look like:
